The Calendar Base extension provides nearly fifty different templates,
any or all of which are fully customizable to suit your needs. The
following instructions will walk you through the process for editing
any of the templates.

**Caution:** Modifying a Calendar Base template is not a task for the
uninitiated. A knowledge of basic HTML and CSS are essential to make
successful modifications. Poor coding can render the template
unusable.

Modifying the template is a three step process:

#. Download a Calendar Base template file

#. Modify the template file

#. Upload and activate the modified template file

Please refer also to chapter “:ref:`Template Files and Markers`” for more
details about the template files.
