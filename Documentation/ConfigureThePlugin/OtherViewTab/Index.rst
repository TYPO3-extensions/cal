- **Show login:** Shows an instance of the Frontend User Login in the
  default Week and Day Views.

- **Show search:** Shows an instance of the search engine that has been
  limited to searching Calendar Base records. See :ref:`AddingASearchOption` for more details.

- **Show jumps:** Shows a Jump menu for Frontend navigation. Allows users to
  quickly “jump” to other weeks, months, or years.

  displayed in the Legend. By enabling or disabling the category check-
  boxes, Frontend users can choose to display or hide events associated
  with specific categories.

  in the default Week and Day Views.
