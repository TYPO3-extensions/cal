**Illustration 24: The Calendar Event: Organizer Tab**

Refer to Illustration 24.
- **Organizer, or...:** This is the title (or name) of the organizer that will be displayed if you have not created an Organizer record and chosen it in the Cal Organizer drop-down menu below. This option can be turned off in the Configuration form (See :ref:`CalendarBaseConfiguration`).

- **Cal Organizer, or...:** These options are generated from :ref:`OrganizerRecords` that you create. If left at None, the displayed organizer will be generated from the Organizer field above. If you make a selection here, it will override the above Organizer field.

- **Page to link the organizer to:** If you have a page that has more information about the organizer, you can link to it here. This link will override the Cal Organizer field and create a link from the Organizer field.
