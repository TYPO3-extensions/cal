The Recurrence Tab

The Recurrence Tab contains fields pertaining to repeating events. The
default setting is None, so if you're scheduling a one-time event, you
can skip this field. The illustration below shows an annual
recurrence, but you can repeat events by the Day, Week, Month, and
Year. Each of the options includes relevant (and similar) fields. Be
sure to save your work when you're finished.

**Illustration 22: The Calendar Event: Recurrence Tab**

Refer to Illustration 22.
- **Frequency:** Sets the frequency of the reoccurring event. Each selection will change the form's relative options.
  
  Notice that there are options such as an  **Until Date** that
  determines how long the frequency will last by setting an end date in
  the field. You could also set the  **Count** that will determine the
  number of times a recurrence will appear. The  **Interval** allows you
  set the event for every-other [year, month, week, day], every-third,
  every-fourth, etc.

- **By Day of the Week:** Sets the recurring event to a specific day/s of
  the week. For instance, the first Monday of the selected month (as
  determined by the By Month field). Click the Add Recurrence icon to
  add an additional instance.

- **By Day of the Month:** Sets the recurring event to the specific date
  in the month. For instance, the 3 :sup:`rd` or the 22 :sup:`nd` .
  Click the Add Recurrence icon to add an additional instance.

- **By Month:** Sets the recurring event to the specific month/s you choose.
