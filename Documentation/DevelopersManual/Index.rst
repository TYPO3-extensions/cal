The developer-level documentation for the Calendar Base extension is a
work in progress. Eventually, the calendar model that other extensions
can plug into will be described here. Likewise, the service-based
views are easily extensible by third-party extensions so examples for
this will be provided as well. In the meantime, a high-level
architecture of the Calendar base extension is provided below.
