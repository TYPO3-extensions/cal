The TYPO3 Calendar Project newsgroup at
news://lists.typo3.org/typo3.projects.calendar is the best place to
get support for any Calendar Base questions. Post your questions and
another user or someone from the development team will probably be
able to help you out.

Apart from the newsgroup, please visit our project page at forge
`(http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-cal)
<http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-cal>`_ and use the
search function there. If you think you found a bug in an official
release, need a new feature (or want to sponsor one) this is the best
place to give it visibility.

In any case, please provide some basic information of your
installation: Which Typo3 version do you use, which cal version, what
kind of TS template (“classic” or “standard”) and what recurrence
model is used.
