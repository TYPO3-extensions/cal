The Calendar Base extension facilitates Backend data entry, Frontend
data entry, as well as parsing of static iCal feeds and subscriptions
to external iCal content. Frontend Registration and logins can limit
which appointments are displayed, thus allowing the use of “multiple
calendars” for personal appointments, etc. In addition to standard
calendar data, extensions such as tt\_news can be configured for
calendar display. Data from each of these source is combined into a
single calendar, offering multiple views such as list, day, week, and
month. In addition to the standard HTML views, iCal feeds and RSS
feeds are produced by the Calendar Base.
